  <div class="entry-content"><p>PAO: The Hornet now estimates they are 4 and three-quarters miles away from the spacecraft.</p>
<p>PAO: 4 minutes away from separation, 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble] there's no way for me [garble] probe and drogue [garble] docking [garble]. TVC Servo Power 1 and 2 are Off?</p>
<p>Aldrin: No, I got to keep the chart. (Under static) Standby for the pitchover.</p>
<p>Collins: You got some things up there.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes. Thank you, Ron.</p>
<p>Armstrong: About out? But it appears to be a very cohesive material of the same sort. Right.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Here you are. Apollo 11. Pitch 1, Off...</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble] let me move in just a [garble]. Thank you much.</p>
<p>Evans: Good morning.</p>
<p>Evans: Roger. And, break. Thank you.</p>
<p>Evans: Columbia and Tranquility, I'll give you a Mark at 20 minutes to go, and that's in about 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Collins: Chamber pressure is 100 psi even. I haven't been at this very long. I see a horizon. We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.</p>
<p>Duke: That's affirmative, Mike. Thank you much. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Think we ought to get the long lens on, Mike? Well, give me an example.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Congratulations.</p>
<p>Duke: Say again. Stand by for my Mark.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. Over. We noticed the Cryo pressure dropped a moment ago. Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: Rog.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, Neil. Appreciate it. GET 194:46:03; 267, plus 11.02, minus 172.03, 06.8. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: About ready for a little help? We're just waiting for the cabin pressure to bleed so...To blow enough pressure to open the hatch. (Pause)</p>
<p>Aldrin: All at once. I have that. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: 11. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. 4.4. I just wanted to confirm that. That's the biggest one you ever seen in your life. [Garble.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger.</p>
<p>Armstrong: ...departed it with a little Delta-V.</p>
<p>Aldrin: That's got it. ) Locked. Houston, looks like there's very little difference between the two (tanks).</p>
<p>Collins: Pitch and Yaw, Auto.</p>
<p>Aldrin: It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving. [Garble] green.</p>
<p>Duke: Stand by. Ready for your readback. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve. We see the card up now. Over.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. Over.</p>
<p>Duke: We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Excuse me. Your friendly White Team has your coming home information, if you're ready to copy. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: (Push-to-Talk) Roger. Charging Batt A, then on to...</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. I'll get the straight story for you.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay, I want to get the lights out then.</p>
<p>McCandless: 11, this is Houston. [Pause.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: Charlie, on the PTC, we're just waiting our 20 minutes here for all thruster activity to damp out. ] Yeah, hello there sports fans. Can you hear our Master Alarm in the background? [No answer.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Yes.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay. Horizon 11-degree line at T<sub>IG</sub> minus 2 minutes. Say again, please.</p>
<p>Armstrong: You can have it if you want it. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.</p>
<p>Collins: You sure you have the right power switch on? Columbia's on the high gain.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble] chart. What do you need?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Radar circuit breaker. Over.</p>
<p>Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: ... I guess...leave them on Inertial for the time being.</p>
<p>McCandless: For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Thank you.</p>
<p>Collins: Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger. Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: We're going to have to check that out. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average;  and (I) understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west;  actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2. Yes.</p>
<p>Collins: Will that one do? As long as you're on Bit-rate Low.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay, we're operate - 59:59.</p>
<p>Collins: I'll bet you we're never going to catch up.</p>
<p>Collins: Maybe we can change the weight, but that's TLI plus 90; we got plenty of time.</p>
<p>Collins: Roger.</p>
<p>Evans: Eagle, Houston. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30 000. We copy. And you might pass to Columbia, we don't have him yet.</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble] this COAS as far as steering and everything goes, it's hopeless. (Cough)</p>
<p>Duke: Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: Roger.</p>
<p>Duke: Stand by, Mike.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yes, just a second. Vega and Deneb; 007, 144, 068. (Pause)</p>
<p>Collins: How would you like the camera? Up, down, zero. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, we're - we're in DAP control. Thank you.</p>
<p>Aldrin: ...some particles jumping around on your screen. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. It would have been 0.8 foot per second. And a maneuver of - and a maneuver of 51.3.</p>
<p>Duke: Stand by, Buzz.</p>
<p>Aldrin: All of a sudden there, we heard a little click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. We'd like you to terminate average G. Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: How'd the - is this the first part of the attitude comparison check or the second part? Oh, that thing is hard.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay. I picked up a little roll. I'd appreciate that. Maybe - remember when the SCS was acting up?</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, 11. We want to get to the proper sleep attitude before we proceed on with the comm check. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: I'm right in the middle of my orange juice. I have roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, and yaw 357.5. Thank you kindly. Well, I promise to let you know if I stop breathing.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, I know there's an orange dot on this ... somewhere. I've got 470 now for R-dot, and I just broke lock. I'm still holding [garble].</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, we got to visually acquire Moon, take pictures, and then you got a P52 to do.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. Standing by for your readback. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: Thank you.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, I got to go to horizontal at 35. What'd he say?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Does it look to you like the [garble] the right way?</p>
<p>Collins: You have to take it easy. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yes, I [garble].</p>
<p>Duke: Five-by, 11. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Shutdown!</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, why - I don't care. Stand by for [garble].</p>
<p>McCandless: Apollo 11, Houston. They really came through in the ninth.</p>
<p>McCandless: Negative.</p>
<p>Collins: I mean the - I mean the whole - I mean the gas consumption would be a lot more than I would have guessed, you know?</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: I updated the LOS time in your...</p>
<p>Armstrong: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Collins: Rog. Okay.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. (For) the RCS configuration, we're requesting you use quads Alpha and Bravo. Mayor Louie Welch promises a lifting of lawn watering restrictions if the rains continue. Out.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p></div>
