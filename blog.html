<p>===============================</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Scraping the Apollo Flight Journals</h2>
<p>I wanted to iterate through each day of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap12fj/">transcripts of the Apollo 12 flight logs</a>
(i.e., the radio dialogue from the Apollo 12 mission), and extracting the text using a Python web scraper.</p>
<p>That text is then parsed to break dialogue up into sentences,
and match dialogue with speakers, all of which is then exported
as a JSON file for olipy, a random text generation library for Python.</p>
<p>This would all be used to create bots that would generate new, fake, 
but plausible random Apollo radio chatter, by chopping up the dialogue
and serving up a remix.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of olipy, which requires a JSON file that looks like this: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonardr/olipy/master/data/apollo_11.txt">apollo 11.txt</a> </p>
<p>A series of lines of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> {
  &quot;tokens&quot;: [
   &quot;Where are we going?&quot;
  ],
  &quot;speaker&quot;: &quot;Conrad&quot;,
  &quot;time&quot;: &quot;000:24:00&quot;
 },
 {
  &quot;tokens&quot;: [
   &quot;AC Bus 1 light, all the fuel cells ... &quot;
  ],
  &quot;speaker&quot;: &quot;Conrad&quot;,
  &quot;time&quot;: &quot;000:25:00&quot;
 },
 {
  &quot;tokens&quot;: [
   &quot;Altitude a mile and a half now.&quot;,
   &quot;Velocity 1,592 feet per second.&quot;
  ],
  &quot;speaker&quot;: &quot;Public Affairs Office&quot;,
  &quot;time&quot;: &quot;000:26:00&quot;
 }
</pre></div>


<p>All of this will allow us to make the <a href="http://twitter.com/apollo12">Apollo 12 Space Junk twitterbot</a> (now created),
a sister of the <a href="http://twitter.com/apollo11junk">Apollo 11 Space Junk twitterbot</a>.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Here's the links to the finished products, if you want to follow along, or skip everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesreid1/wordswordswords/master/apollo12/data/apollo_12.txt">apollo 12.txt</a> - finished product, parsed JSON text of the Apollo 12 flight journals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/charlesreid1/wordswordswords/tree/master/apollo12">apollo 12 scrapeit.py</a> - the Python script utilizing BeautifulSoup and Mechanize that I am walking you through on this post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scraping with Python</h2>
<p>I decided to use <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/">Mechanize</a>,
just cuz I wanted to learn how.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> 
cuz it's a breeze.</p>
<p>I was interested in extracting the text from each of the 10 days listed on the 
Apollo 12 Flight Journal page. So I fired up mechanize and BeautifulSoup:</p>
<h3>Getting Each Log Day Page</h3>
<p>The first bit of the script obtains the HTML 
of the main page. This is where the links to each 
day are, and we can iterate through links to find
links whose text contains "Day ".</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">mechanize</span>

<p>Next is iterating through all the links with the soup object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">soup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BeautifulSoup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">html_doc</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="n">log_links</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">link_name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># follow those links!!!</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>A Whole Bunch of Crummy Low-Level Text Wrangling</h2>
<p>I had to do a bunch of nonsense to get the text
properly encoded and decoded, namely, find and replace
ascii characters like 1/2, single and double quotes,
emdashes and endashes, etc.</p>
<h2>Sentence Tokenization with NLTK</h2>
<p>Now we can start using the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)</a>
to parse the text:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">nltk</span>

    <span class="c1"># tokenize by sentence:</span>
    <span class="n">tokens</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">nltk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tokenize</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sent_tokenize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">booty</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I then did some cleaning up of the tokens, to split at colons and hyphens
(delineating speakers from dialogue).</p>
<h3>Speakers and Dialogue</h3>
<p>Now I get to the hard part: parsing who says what.</p>
<p>I started by defining all the speakers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="n">speakers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Public Affairs Office&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;SC&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;MS&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Carr&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Conrad&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Gordon&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Gibson&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Bean&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;ARIA&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;MS&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;SC&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Weitz&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;Lind&#39;</span>
        <span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Next, some regular expression magic to get rid of timestamps 
appearing next to speakers' names:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="c1"># replace timestamps 000:00:00</span>
    <span class="c1"># look for &quot;last updated&quot; location</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="n">last_updated_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">jj</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">tok</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">enumerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tokens</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">any</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">speaker</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">tok</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">speaker</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">speakers</span><span class="p">]):</span>

        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="s1">&#39;last updated&#39;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">tok</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">():</span>

</pre></div>


<p>The last step is to put all this information into a 
Python dictionary, with keys "speaker", "tokens",
and "time". I'm generating a fake timestamp, 
incremented by one minute with each line of 
dialogue, since timestamps aren't used consistently
through the flight journal, and so long as order is 
preserved, aren't as important to the text generation process.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="n">ii</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">ii</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tokens</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>You can see that I am compiling a Python list containing

<p>===============================</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: - then we'll get to the waste-water dump [garble]. Sometimes it tells us things and sometimes we tell it things and mostly it talks to us. Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay, Mike, our CDH time is 126:17:45.58.</p>
<p>Collins: Columbia.</p>
<p>Collins: Rotational Hand Controller, number 2, is Armed. I got a horrible squeal.</p>
<p>Aldrin: It's filthy. ]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay. No medication. Over. (Long Pause) Look at that.</p>
<p>Armstrong: In the - I mean, in the reticle. About now, I guess.</p>
<p>Collins: Houston, Columbia.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by? We'd like you to confirm your Up-telemtry switch in the Normal position. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, yes, yes. Go.</p>
<p>McCandless: That's affirmative. They'll hang in there for about another 47 hours or so. AOS at Carnarvon 02:25:30. It may be - are you operating on VOX?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Or could you tell? [Long pause.] Now it's taking it out.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Well, we didn't have any plans to, no. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw.</p>
<p>Collins: ECS Radiator Flow Control, Primary. But that might make it better and maybe a little bit worse.</p>
<p>Duke: Copy. You're a lot better now. Certainly appreciate that.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger. Going to Delta. Have you about maneuvered there, yet? It's just a blow-up of the second one. Sextant star between 79:30:10 and 79:52:10.</p>
<p>Duke: Rog. We need Auto, please, sir.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, I got to go to horizontal at 35. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity.</p>
<p>PAO: Mark. We should next reacquire Apollo 11 at 135 hours, 34 minutes, 5 seconds. Present velocity, 25,560 feet per second. And its maiden checkout in communications, the Lunar Module Eagle looked good. The crew should be burning at this time.</p>
<p>PAO: Mission Director George Hage has just thanked the flight controllers assembled here in the Control Center on behalf of himself and General Phillips for the way in which they conducted this mission.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. And the next question from our panel is to Buzz. We did a minor reconfiguration down here. This is Houston. All systems Go. Over. AOS Tananarive is 2 hours, 9 minutes and 18 seconds. For your information, your heads will be pointed roughly towards the Earth on this burn. Over. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moon-struck by the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Oh, is that right? [Garble] looks okay, Mike.</p>
<p>Collins: Thank you. Is that alright?</p>
<p>Collins: Eagle, Columbia.</p>
<p>Collins: ...so you can - enter on this one. We do likewise.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, we're - we're in DAP control.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger. You suppose you could turn the Earth a little bit so we could get a little bit more than just water? Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Well, Mike probably let him out. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the Command Module.</p>
<p>Duke: Rog, Tranquility. Say again your roll angle, Buzz. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: No.</p>
<p>Duke: Apollo 11, Houston. We... Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Not where the waste management's concerned.</p>
<p>Collins: In the rain.</p>
<p>Aldrin: While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Ouch!</p>
<p>Aldrin: Oh... stop there? Okay?</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, and my optics eyepieces are stowed.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter? I agree with that. Don't you like this one?</p>
<p>Collins: No matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces in their box, it doesn't seem right. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 31365.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Yes.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. Go. Okay, we're there.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay. Here's the pitch. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Evans: Eagle, Houston. Command Module RCS looks fine to us.</p>
<p>PAO: Drogue chute deployment time is 195 hours, 12 minutes, 8 seconds.</p>
<p>Air Boss: This is Air Boss 1.</p>
<p>PAO: Downrange 530 miles, altitude 95 miles, velocity 17,358 feet per second.</p>
<p>Duke: Eagle, this is Houston. Houston. We're ready to spin it up.</p>
<p>Collins: That's affirmative. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: Rog. Houston. And break.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, that's just an old vectors, because I never did Verb 66, I don't think, after [garble].</p>
<p>Armstrong: Shutdown!</p>
<p>Collins: Stand by one. I have conflicting information between my cue card and my Flight Plan.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>Duke: Eagle, this is Houston. We've got a preliminary TEI-30 PAD, if you're ready to copy. Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: You guys agree with my mark; we'll be 5 minutes? It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width as the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Armstrong: The EVA light still does work.</p>
<p>Collins: Do you have any idea whether they landed left or right of center line? Do you have us on high bit rate here now?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston... Copy.</p>
<p>Collins: It's a pleasure to be able to waste gas. I hope they've  got a nice, big, strong [garble] for you.</p>
<p>Armstrong: ...and you could be busy getting up supplies if you... [Long pause.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Yes indeed, Buzz. They're on about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay. Ready to copy. Over. Over. We have just entered Verb 77 on page Surface-52 and are ready to proceed with the hot fire.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Well, I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Roger. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: Plaster of paris gray to me. [Garble.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble.] Suit power is Off.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay. How about the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Did you get that, Mike? I have in F/2-22, column Lima, item 6, 00001; item 7, 02134. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain, but we can clearly see the western coast of North America, the United States, the San Joaquin Valley, the High Sierras, Baja California, and Mexico down as far as Acapulco, and the Yucatan Peninsula; and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezuela, and Colombia.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Yaw 270, pitch minus 50. (Long Pause)</p>
<p>Aldrin: Can you think of any use for a slide rule in the LM, Neil?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Copy.</p>
<p>Armstrong: 11.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Evans: Hey, that's affirmative, by gosh. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. PGNS, AGS, and MSFN all agree.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: Columbia. Stand by for ullage.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, we want color. I still question that seven-tenths rate with two-tenths loaded into the DAP, though. 135 hours, 23 minutes; something like that?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Tape Recorder is going to Command Reset on the High Bit Rate.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. There's no problem fuel-wise.</p>
<p>McCandless: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, good. I [garble].</p>
<p>Armstrong: I'll do that, Buzz.</p>
<p>Armstrong: That's more than we've ever had in the simulator, isn't it?</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger, Mike. That sounds fine to us.</p>
<p>McCandless: Okay. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: What time you got?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Right.</p>
<p>Collins: Here's about where we are, [garble]. Is that right?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay. Houston, Eagle.</p>
<p>onboard): Master Arm is On.</p>
<p>onboard): I didn't hear that (garbled)</p>
<p>onboard): Master Arm is On.</p>
<p>onboard): Okay (Long Pause)</p>
<p>onboard): Oh yeah, now I just see the edge of it.</p>
<p>Aldrin: We're burning, Mike. 1344 4793, minus 165 04923. I think that it's about as level as any other areas that we chose.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. They're on about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: (You) got it!</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, 11. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the Flight Plan, and the High Gain angles are good as shown in the Flight Plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131:05 down to 10 percent.</p>
<p>Collins: Columbia's locked up on the high gain, Houston. [Long pause.] [Pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: Apollo 11, Houston. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble] just before that last call.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Can I hold something for you?</p>
<p>Collins: That's all right.</p>
<p>Aldrin: See how am I doing.</p>
<p>Collins: You'll have - You'll have fun at the press conference after this shift then, won't you?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Shades of Gemini. You're right at the edge of the porch.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Alright.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Roll; 000, 007, 000. Over. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Houston, Eagle.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Very good. There are a couple more off to the left, but this one looks [a] fairly good size. I don't think it's because of the waste-water particles that it would lack its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Collins: Thank you.</p>
<p>Aldrin: You can go to your... I got it now.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Still got some here?</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. TEI-1, SPS/G&N; 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65, T<sub>IG</sub>, 078:02:03.45; plus 2918.0, plus 0377.9, minus 0132.5; roll NA, pitch 041. Is it useful now? [Pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>McCandless: Mode IV capability. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O<sub>2</sub> flow on your onboard gauge? [Pause.] [No answer.]</p>
<p>McCandless: 11, this is Houston. I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack.</p>
<p>Armstrong: We'll stand by for your call.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going? Okay, through with that? The islands in the Caribbean there, beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Ron's getting to be known as the silent CapCom. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA one-five (15) minutes from nominal.</p>
<p>Armstrong: ... 190, 110 degrees.</p>
<p>Collins: You ready to do it?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Can't get too much further away. Check my diverter valve's vertical.</p>
<p>Evans: 11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, I see you don't have any landing gear.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell. Stand by. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: 1 or 2 degrees, Neil? Those are Buzz's two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the right-hand window, window Number 5.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Well, I've got one here.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Simulated crying]</p>
<p>Collins: I'm doing it, Charlie. Sure can.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Well, its a bit like zodiacal light.</p>
<p>Collins: Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation burn attitude.</p>
<p>Duke: And we've got almost 3 minutes to go, Neil. Go ahead, Mike. [Long pause.] Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yeah. [Garble].</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, 11. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the Command Module the following items. In the remarks: T-2 occurs at PDI plus 21:26.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yes, they're not - [garble].</p>
<p>Collins: Circuit breakers - SPS Pitch 1, Pitch 2, Yaw 1, Yaw 2, Open? Buzz is usually looking... just watch window 5 for a second.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, where's the freaking Earth going to be now? It looks like an awful big one.</p>
<p>Collins: Houston, Apollo 11.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. We're on low bit rate at the present time so it's going to take us a little bit longer than normal to get this stuff up to you. The High Gain antenna track in Manual.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Sure is squiggly, isn't it?</p>
<p>Collins: Ullage is going to be 16 seconds at 2 jets.</p>
<p>Collins: It's sort of messy. I got my gouge...</p>
<p>Aldrin: Hey, Charlie, I can see the snow on the - on the mountains out in California, and it looks like LA doesn't have much of a smog problem today.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay. We appreciate all that fine work done by the - by the Green Team, and we'll be thanking you in person when we get back.</p></div>

<p>Gibson: Apollo 12, Houston. [LOS Rev 19.] We'll keep you posted on the games that are going on this afternoon. 161:58:05 CT No problem. The Buckeyes are favored to win and retain their number 1 rating. What essentially we're doing is looking at the effect of primary versus secondary transponder or primary versus secondary electronics and Wide Beam width versus Narrow Beam width.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control at 25 hours, 18 minutes. So this would be the heaters associated with that system. We're standing by for a resumption of conversation...</p>
<p>Carr: I'm going to give you 1-second lead so it will be 10 when it gets there.</p>
<p>Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Carr: Apollo 12, Houston. Question number 3. Roger.?</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, Intrepid.</p>
<p>Carr: Apollo 12, Houston. Thank you.</p>
<p>Carr: 12,Houston. Star number 161 is still good; star number 174 is still good; and 26 is still good for the third sighting. Stand by. We'll give them to you at Carnarvon. He and I have both seen that phenomena on your DEDA during testing of most all the spacecrafts up at Bethpage, and it's probably an EMI.</p>
<p>Carr: Okay, Pete.</p>
<p>Carr: Okay, that takes care of the paper work for this pass.</p>
<p>Carr: That one doesn't compute.</p>
<p>Carr: Ain't that nice! We're consulting our oracle right now.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, Pete. Sure you don't want that geology pop quiz?</p>
<p>Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Okay.</p>
<p>Carr: 12, Houston. Go.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay, Houston. I don't have the complete orange ball in the sextant, but I've got the better half of it.</p>
<p>Gordon: Roger, Omni Bravo.</p>
<p>Bean: Let her go, then.</p>
<p>Gordon: Roger.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, Dick. The computer's yours. Well, that sounds fine, Al.</p>
<p>Carr: Did you get the word that Amy was visited by the tooth fairy?</p>
<p>Carr: Okay, Dick. We saw your manifold pressures change a little bit, so it does look like they fired. Go ahead, Pete.</p>
<p>Gordon: [Garble].</p>
<p>Gordon: I haven't trimmed in roll.</p>
<p>Gordon: Roger. Loud and clear. Houston, 12,</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay, it's all yours.</p>
<p>Gordon: No, sir. Let me know when that thing impacts, so I can shut off this camera, because I can't see it through the telescope?</p>
<p>Gordon: 38:20. I'm reading you.</p>
<p>Conrad: Yes. That makes it pretty nice. None that The water's been chlorinated. The pre-sleep checklist is complete. Go ahead, Houston.</p>
<p>Gordon: Go ahead, Houston.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay. We're ready to copy.</p>
<p>Gordon: Hey, are you doing good? Thank you.</p>
<p>Gordon: Min.</p>
<p>Bean: Yes, Pete.</p>
<p>Bean: Looks like it's right on.</p>
<p>Bean: [Garble] Houston.</p>
<p>Conrad: Mark. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Gordon: Yes. we're all there except for the Servo Electronics to Primary, and I'm in the Secondary Transponder and going to Primary Transponder at this time. Ullage Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.</p>
<p>Gordon: Hey, Ed.</p>
<p>Gordon: These puddings are [garble]  with milk.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger. I don't know that there could be any questions.</p>
<p>Bean: It's almost as high as the rim itself.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control Houston at 170 hours, 4   minutes now into the flight. This is Mission Control, Houston, 5 hours, 1 minute.</p>
<p>Weitz: Hello, 12; Houston. Today's a voting day in Houston as Houston picks a mayor, eight councilmen, four school-board members, and decides upon a number of special issues. Your sextant star is 10, 241.7 A reminder is that the camera settings for your fireball and chutes photos are not in the checklist. The launch is being described with such adjectives as spooky and cliff hanging. Page Delta/Alfa-6, step 1. I can't talk to you any longer, there's another call coming in. The Noun 81 Roger.</p>
<p>Weitz: [Laughter] I'll go on [laughter]. We just want to get a check on the rate.</p>
<p>Weitz: Go ahead, 12. Okay, who won the vote on what you're playing on the tape recorder?</p>
<p>Conrad: Five minutes, 3,403, 156 feet, and out at 47,000.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay. that We'll go get her.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: Roger. And, Al Bean, you give me a Tape Recorder? No, you don't have to do that.</p>
<p>Conrad: Yes, and if you spike both of them, you got the whole shooting match. Would you just give me the Noun 47 again?</p>
<p>Conrad: What happened there?</p>
<p>Conrad: Roll's complete.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay.</p>
<p>Bean: If you can see that.</p>
<p>Conrad: Hey, Dick?</p>
<p>Conrad: That's correct.</p>
<p>Conrad: I'll tell you another thing it is; it's the thrusters
 - 4,500 feet at 30 feet a second. Hell, my window's all foggy.</p>
<p>Weitz: Stand by.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: Apollo 12 now 24,200 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft presently some 5,900 nautical miles from the Moon, traveling at a speed of 4,391 feet per second.</p>
<p>Gordon: Pete, I have you in 60.49 by 9.0.</p>
<p>Carr: Apollo 12, Houston.</p>
<p>Carr: Wilco.</p>
<p>Carr: Thank you. I have a DAP PAD and a TEI-34 PAD for you.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: Well, I don't think we paid that much attention to it, other than when we were aware of it; it was all around us like the Surveyor crater. Hey, Houston, if it's all right with you, we will go ahead and secure the TV.</p>
<p>Conrad: Roger.</p>
<p>Conrad: No, they were that way yesterday. The Service Module thrusters wouldn't show up with water and, even if they did, it would be long gone; and I've still got a big block of ice sitting outside my window here, so I hope they all fire right.</p>
<p>Conrad: It's holding real good, Dick.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 54 minutes Capcom Don Lind is preparing to put in a call to the crew shortly.</p>
<p>Gibson: Well, it looks like we got another page in the malfunction book.</p>
<p>Gibson: Dick, could you give us P00? RTG output is around 73 watts, and as of just a short while ago, they've sent up a total of 382 commands. and the ones coming up. Say again, 12.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, we can go now to the P23 attitude, but we'd like you to roll 180 from that attitude for thermal reasons. We still have a lot of garbling, and broken up.</p>
<p>Gibson: Roger, Dick. [ 00 mins 08 sec]</p>
<p>Gibson: Pete, would you verify that you left the circuit breakers in the LM according to the configuration on activation 3 and 4 except Would you say again?</p>
<p>Gibson: Stand by on that, Pete. Color exterior.</p>
<p>Gibson: Okay, 12. Roger, Al; will do.</p>
<p>Gibson: Hello, 12; Houston. the correct position relative to your mouth.</p>
<p>Gibson: Dick, it sounds good, but you're slightly garbled.</p>
<p>Gibson: Dick, say again. Numbers are good, and that's on page 1-32.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, Houston. Pete, that's affirmative.</p>
<p>Conrad: Say, I guess nobody else has</p>
<p>Conrad: That's it, Al. We just changed out the LiOH canister per Flight Plan, and we're ready for the news.</p>
<p>Bean: Stand by.</p>
<p>Conrad: This kit isn't medication; that's just... You've got a big job now. Dick, you're cleared to go the AGS Cal attitude, and we're standing by.</p>
<p>Conrad: Thank you.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control Houston at 170 hours, 4   minutes now into the flight.</p>
<p>Gibson: Clipper, you have A-C rolls selected in the DAP.</p>
<p>Gibson: Pete and Al, we're back with you.</p>
<p>Gibson: Apollo 12, Houston. 12, go ahead.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, Houston.</p>
<p>Gibson: Okay. While you're sitting there backed up to the fire, we have some news for you, if you like.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, Houston. That's F:11 for the Earth, F:8 for the Moon.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control, Houston at 187 hours, and 48 minutes into the flight. We've had discussions with the crew who asked about the type of film to be used in their window photography. Their rest period is scheduled to start on this revolution around the moon. This is Mission Control, Houston, 5 hours, 1 minute.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay. [Garble].</p>
<p>Gordon: Well, hello there, stranger.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay. Up Telemetry, Block, the Command Module; and Up, Block, the IU.</p>
<p>Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper.</p>
<p>Bean: 49...</p>
<p>Bean: Off.</p>
<p>Bean: Got drogues, Houston. Here comes something, just...</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay. Houston, Apollo 12.</p>
<p>Conrad:  ...blood to your head at a Take pictures next Rev.</p>
<p>Conrad: Pyro Arm. Let's say you had a strip that was about a foot wide, that you just bent it and made a little triangular thing out of it. Communications throughout the whole launch were outstanding. Watch those...</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control at 127 hours, 9 minutes.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, 12.</p>
<p>Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Roger.</p>
<p>Carr: That's affirmative. If you need it, go ahead and use it every 3 hours.</p>
<p>Conrad: Show you Just stowing your hose and thing.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: That's it, pal.</p>
<p>Gordon: The EMS checked out satisfactorily. What goodies?</p>
<p>Gordon: If not, we'll look at the Earth for a while.</p>
<p>Gordon: Houston, this is 12.</p>
<p>Conrad: Any objections to us starting P57 now?</p>
<p>Gordon: I knew you had to have something somewhere. I have 18 millimeter.</p>
<p>Bean: It's coming right out in all directions [garble] slow
 I was thinking they're dropping from my water boiler, but it looks like some of those things are escaping the Moon. Clean up those What we do is, Pete gets over on his side, which is the left side of the spacecraft, this side over here. All that stuff [garble] transfer over.</p>
<p>Bean: Okay, I am going to start doing that right now.</p>
<p>Bean: Okay, do Comm [garble]. Hey, Pete, if you point the camera up there toward the north, you can show them a couple of long rilles.</p>
<p>Conrad: Houston, I can step ahead here and do RCS checkout if you want, right now. That's about all I can say for them. [Singing].</p>
<p>Conrad:  Boy, that would just put the frost on the cake, you know that? Otherwise, it's been steady as a rock.</p>
<p>Conrad: 38 feet per second. This yours, Al?</p>
<p>Conrad: All right.</p>
<p>Conrad: ...your heart's pumping ... You and Joe and all the guys put together a great lunar surface LM; that thing went without a hitch.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay, Houston, the cryos have been stirred for 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Gordon: What's the matter, Al?</p>
<p>Carr: Roger. We're getting a good view of the right-hand compartment now, and we can see your helmet stowage bag down there in the corner, that spherical white bag.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Gordon: Say again.</p>
<p>Conrad: Don't worry about it; you're in good shape. Okay.</p>
<p>Carr: Okay. We're 1 minute from LOS. 12, Houston. The Saints are looking pretty good. Roger.</p>
<p>Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston with a P22 tracking PAD. Let us get the state vector in first.</p>
<p>Bean: Yes, I guess.</p>
<p>Weitz: Okay. It's midcourse 7 RCS/G&N; Roger.</p>
<p>Weitz: Got it.</p>
<p>Weitz: You have everybody up and about there? Czechoslovak television carried live coverage of the lift-off, complete with explanation of technical details. We can see it very good. [ 00 mins 31 sec]</p>
<p>Weitz: Roger.</p>
<p>Weitz: Okay. We tried to get an Omni Alfa call to you, but didn't get it in in time, I guess.</p>
<p>Weitz: And, 12; Houston. Give us Omni Bravo, please.</p>
<p>Weitz: Roger. A minimum housing code and a freedom-of-choice integration plan won strong support. We've got it, 12. Roger, Pete.</p></div>

<p>===============================</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PAO: The Hornet now estimates they are 4 and three-quarters miles away from the spacecraft.</p>
<p>PAO: 4 minutes away from separation, 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble] there's no way for me [garble] probe and drogue [garble] docking [garble]. TVC Servo Power 1 and 2 are Off?</p>
<p>Aldrin: No, I got to keep the chart. (Under static) Standby for the pitchover.</p>
<p>Collins: You got some things up there.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes. Thank you, Ron.</p>
<p>Armstrong: About out? But it appears to be a very cohesive material of the same sort. Right.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Here you are. Apollo 11. Pitch 1, Off...</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble] let me move in just a [garble]. Thank you much.</p>
<p>Evans: Good morning.</p>
<p>Evans: Roger. And, break. Thank you.</p>
<p>Evans: Columbia and Tranquility, I'll give you a Mark at 20 minutes to go, and that's in about 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Collins: Chamber pressure is 100 psi even. I haven't been at this very long. I see a horizon. We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.</p>
<p>Duke: That's affirmative, Mike. Thank you much. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Think we ought to get the long lens on, Mike? Well, give me an example.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Congratulations.</p>
<p>Duke: Say again. Stand by for my Mark.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. Over. We noticed the Cryo pressure dropped a moment ago. Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: Rog.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, Neil. Appreciate it. GET 194:46:03; 267, plus 11.02, minus 172.03, 06.8. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: About ready for a little help? We're just waiting for the cabin pressure to bleed so...To blow enough pressure to open the hatch. (Pause)</p>
<p>Aldrin: All at once. I have that. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: 11. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. 4.4. I just wanted to confirm that. That's the biggest one you ever seen in your life. [Garble.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger.</p>
<p>Armstrong: ...departed it with a little Delta-V.</p>
<p>Aldrin: That's got it. ) Locked. Houston, looks like there's very little difference between the two (tanks).</p>
<p>Collins: Pitch and Yaw, Auto.</p>
<p>Aldrin: It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving. [Garble] green.</p>
<p>Duke: Stand by. Ready for your readback. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve. We see the card up now. Over.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. Over.</p>
<p>Duke: We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Excuse me. Your friendly White Team has your coming home information, if you're ready to copy. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: (Push-to-Talk) Roger. Charging Batt A, then on to...</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. I'll get the straight story for you.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay, I want to get the lights out then.</p>
<p>McCandless: 11, this is Houston. [Pause.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: Charlie, on the PTC, we're just waiting our 20 minutes here for all thruster activity to damp out. ] Yeah, hello there sports fans. Can you hear our Master Alarm in the background? [No answer.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Yes.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay. Horizon 11-degree line at T<sub>IG</sub> minus 2 minutes. Say again, please.</p>
<p>Armstrong: You can have it if you want it. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.</p>
<p>Collins: You sure you have the right power switch on? Columbia's on the high gain.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble] chart. What do you need?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Radar circuit breaker. Over.</p>
<p>Evans: Roger. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: ... I guess...leave them on Inertial for the time being.</p>
<p>McCandless: For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Thank you.</p>
<p>Collins: Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger. Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: We're going to have to check that out. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average;  and (I) understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west;  actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2. Yes.</p>
<p>Collins: Will that one do? As long as you're on Bit-rate Low.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay, we're operate - 59:59.</p>
<p>Collins: I'll bet you we're never going to catch up.</p>
<p>Collins: Maybe we can change the weight, but that's TLI plus 90; we got plenty of time.</p>
<p>Collins: Roger.</p>
<p>Evans: Eagle, Houston. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30 000. We copy. And you might pass to Columbia, we don't have him yet.</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble] this COAS as far as steering and everything goes, it's hopeless. (Cough)</p>
<p>Duke: Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: Roger.</p>
<p>Duke: Stand by, Mike.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yes, just a second. Vega and Deneb; 007, 144, 068. (Pause)</p>
<p>Collins: How would you like the camera? Up, down, zero. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, we're - we're in DAP control. Thank you.</p>
<p>Aldrin: ...some particles jumping around on your screen. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. It would have been 0.8 foot per second. And a maneuver of - and a maneuver of 51.3.</p>
<p>Duke: Stand by, Buzz.</p>
<p>Aldrin: All of a sudden there, we heard a little click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. We'd like you to terminate average G. Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: How'd the - is this the first part of the attitude comparison check or the second part? Oh, that thing is hard.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay. I picked up a little roll. I'd appreciate that. Maybe - remember when the SCS was acting up?</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, 11. We want to get to the proper sleep attitude before we proceed on with the comm check. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: I'm right in the middle of my orange juice. I have roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, and yaw 357.5. Thank you kindly. Well, I promise to let you know if I stop breathing.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, I know there's an orange dot on this ... somewhere. I've got 470 now for R-dot, and I just broke lock. I'm still holding [garble].</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, we got to visually acquire Moon, take pictures, and then you got a P52 to do.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. Standing by for your readback. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: Thank you.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, I got to go to horizontal at 35. What'd he say?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Does it look to you like the [garble] the right way?</p>
<p>Collins: You have to take it easy. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yes, I [garble].</p>
<p>Duke: Five-by, 11. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Shutdown!</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, why - I don't care. Stand by for [garble].</p>
<p>McCandless: Apollo 11, Houston. They really came through in the ninth.</p>
<p>McCandless: Negative.</p>
<p>Collins: I mean the - I mean the whole - I mean the gas consumption would be a lot more than I would have guessed, you know?</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: I updated the LOS time in your...</p>
<p>Armstrong: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Collins: Rog. Okay.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. (For) the RCS configuration, we're requesting you use quads Alpha and Bravo. Mayor Louie Welch promises a lifting of lawn watering restrictions if the rains continue. Out.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: That's affirmative.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, now.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay, Charlie.</p>
<p>Collins: (Not having heard Evans yet) How goes it?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Yes, I'll look.</p>
<p>Collins: Our chamber pressure onboard was higher that time, too.</p>
<p>Armstrong: You're right.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Garriott: Roger, Mike. I suggest you move back away. Two more verifications, here. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: That's okay. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Collins: Amazing how quickly you adapt. And time to stop also, please.</p>
<p>Aldrin: What did you have on [garble]? It's still hooked in it. 60...</p>
<p>Armstrong: Oh, I got them.</p>
<p>McCandless: 11, this is Houston. ]</p>
<p>Collins: By 54 point... As a matter of curiosity, our O<sub>2</sub> flow meter is pegged full-scale High.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Oh, must have been around - 210. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Ignition time? Greens do not show up very well. Alright.</p>
<p>Collins: It's...Menkent.</p>
<p>McCandless: Cliff is not on right now. If you want to go that way, crank it up, and then you can drive it around and look where you want.</p>
<p>Collins: You ready to do it? And I'm locked on and I got about a half signal strength, and they can't hear me.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Excuse me.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay. [No answer.]</p>
<p>Duke: Apollo 11, Houston. It's really superb. The rates are damped out well enough for you to initiate the PTC now. Our biggest drift on the gyro's is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-Gyro. [Pause.] Out. Would he please go to High Gain. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: Clockwise.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Go ahead. Buzz?</p>
<p>Duke: 11, Houston. We see that. It's a typo error. How do you read - normal voice? Out.</p>
<p>Collins: Roger.</p>
<p>Aldrin: [Garble] take that.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Alrighty.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, then we're not at the substellar point, if we're not. Okay.</p>
<p>Armstrong: We might make it in time.</p>
<p>McCandless: 11, Houston. Break. He's been over the hill, here, for a minute or so. Do you read? Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, only one camera, but I've got [garble] lenses. We understood that, Charlie.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Armstrong: 0.01. ...not really.</p>
<p>Armstrong: This one here?</p>
<p>Collins: Oh, yes, alright. Tell everybody take your sweet time. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. I've been in Delta the whole time but it doesn't seem to be [garble].</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, 96:01. Roger on the time;  and you want to cycle the fan...</p>
<p>McCandless: [Laughter] Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Delta Azimuth correction is plus 0.22, that is plus .22, and we do recommend the P52 alignment. If you're ready, we have a   update that we can pass up to you at this time, if you will give us P00 and Accept. Amen to that.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Out.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Armstrong: 15 - we're 7 minutes away.</p>
<p>Collins: Negative that. I've got that in work. Ready to copy.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble]?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Duke: Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We've lost our command interface with Goldstone. What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?</p>
<p>Collins: Fine.</p>
<p>McCandless: Oh, we were wondering what was new with you up there. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Yes. (Pause)  Got it. 25...</p>
<p>Collins: Thrusting... We're going to leave it this way for TEI, right? Over.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger.</p>
<p>Duke: 11, that was a good picture there. We got a lot of noise in the background. (Pause)</p>
<p>Duke: 11, Houston. Mike, see you in the background. So we're real satisfied with the way the gyros are looking. Houston. You've got a Go.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Range/range rate is [garble].</p>
<p>Armstrong: Yes.</p>
<p>McCandless: Go ahead, 11. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay, Mike, we passed the star check. We're up to 6...</p>
<p>Armstrong: Get the [garble], Buzz.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. Over. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Roger, Houston.</p>
<p>Collins: The razor wasn't in there?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>Duke: Eagle, Houston. We'll be happy to have you back.</p>
<p>Collins: I guess what I'm doing, I should do with the paper towels.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Oh, yes, I got it.</p>
<p>Collins: That's correct.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble].</p>
<p>Collins: 35, 30 minutes. Ho, ho, ho!</p>
<p>Evans: Roger. Request P00 and Accept, and we'll give you a good ole LM vector. Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay, 6...okay, about 5 seconds to nominal. Allow probe to damp spacecraft oscillations?</p>
<p>McCandless: 11, this is Houston.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Level sense arm at 8 plus 17; outboard cut-off at 9 plus 11. We will then command Omni Delta down here after you advise us you've switched, and then you can select Bravo on board and we'll be back in the Omni antenna commanding business. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Duke: Eagle, Houston. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: Thank you, sir. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: You got it all vented now?</p>
<p>Collins: Yes.</p>
<p>Aldrin: [Garble]. There's no problem. Okay.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger. You want to try...?</p>
<p>Evans: Roger. Your Uncle Bob Moon accompanied him on the visit which included the LRL. Request Guidance Control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Columbia, Houston...</p>
<p>Evans: Columbia, Houston. Say again.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Got Delta-V? Dump.</p>
<p>Armstrong: We've got a - pitchdown and then a yaw to do...</p>
<p>Duke: That's one of those... It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Could you open the f-stop a little bit more? Roger.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. We have the LM ascent Pad. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: Negative. Roger.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>McCandless: [Laughter] Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Reading you loud and clear. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Houston, 11. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Hey, we're closing in a leisurely fashion. How's our thruster firing activity? Beautiful.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Roger. Give me a time to load.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Negative.</p>
<p>McCandless: Say again, please.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Rog. Tomorrow, take - we're going to have to carry a lot of film to take as many pictures as they want.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, Neil. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: Somehow we'll figure a way to [garble].</p>
<p>Duke: What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now? It's a real steady picture, here. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: What was you doing?</p>
<p>Duke: Hello, Columbia.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, let me get my - let me get my gouge out here.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Going to CSI Pad. Yes.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. Doesn't seem to me, for the PAD we got, we...we want to load in any...</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. We recommend an Auto maneuver to the attitudes in the - pen-and-inked into the Flight Plan. At time approximately 22:30 in the Flight Plan, in your post-sleep checklist, and in all other post-sleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says Auto RCS Jet Select, 16, to On, and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble]. Thank you.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay.</p>
<p>Duke: Rog, Tranquility. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Aldrin: When we get the Sun behind us, we might be able to. They're welcome.</p>
<p>Collins: You ought to check the Flight Plan, it doesn't mention the (laughter) probe or the drogue.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger, I have it. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and [pause] - Now, no, wait a minute. On descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. Before I do that I would like to designate the   up to plus-X.</p>
<p>Evans: Roger, Columbia. (Pause)  Tranquility, affirmative. We see you getting ready for Sep. Everything looks mighty fine down here.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Buzz can hold it, and you're going to run the monitor.</p>
<p>Collins: I'll bet you a cup of coffee on it.</p>
<p>McCandless: Columbia, this is Houston.</p>
<p>Collins: Start after the rains in Houston. Yes.</p>
<p>Collins: [Very weak.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: Roger.</p>
<p>McCandless: Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Buzz, this is Houston through Tranquility. (To Mike) Stand by please.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Copy. It's 151, there's [garble], okay? Mark.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, you know, - well, just looking at that one sample, it was - I'm surprised you didn't have a lot more dust. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. We think you're close, but no cigar.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Do you have any idea where the S-IVB is with respect to us?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Eagle.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Eagle.</p>
<p>Collins: [Very weak.] We've - you got to us just a little late. And 3.8.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble] just before that last call. And we have all the fans Off.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger.</p>
<p>Armstrong: They're all up.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, pressure - you might get a little drop in it, I don't really know, but it came back up.</p>
<p>Aldrin: We ought to be able to get it...</p>
<p>McCandless: Sounds like one of these rotating restaurants. Roger...</p>
<p>Honeysuckle: Honeysuckle. Read you loud and clear.</p>
<p>Comm: Houston CapCom, Goldstone M&amp;O Net 1. Read you the same.</p>
<p>Comm: Roger. Thank you.</p>
<p>Comm: Roger. Thank you.</p>
<p>Network: Okay. Stand by a minute, Goldstone.</p>
<p>Comm: Okay.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay. I got plenty of cable?</p>
<p>Duke: Rog, Neil. We'd like you to pull the circuit breaker on panel 11 for the mission timer. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Roger. How does the roll attitude look?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Armstrong: (Laughs)  A particularly good thought.</p>
<p>Aldrin: [Garble]. Oh, crap.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Faint] This is 11, Houston. PAD angles: Delta-V<sub>GX</sub> after trim was 0.1, V<sub>GY</sub> 0.9, V<sub>GZ</sub> 0.1. Yes.</p></div>
