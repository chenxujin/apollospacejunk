  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gordon: Zero. We ought to get...</p>
<p>Gordon: Yes, 09:11. On one pass, I put the camera on the sextant. Okay.</p>
<p>Gordon: In fact Hello, Houston; 12.</p>
<p>Bean: I'll put in the pole, and I'll step back, so that...</p>
<p>Bean: I got it.</p>
<p>Gibson: Apollo 12, Houston.</p>
<p>Gibson: Roger.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, confirm do you have the valuable Yankee Clipper, Houston.</p>
<p>Gibson: Apollo 12, Houston. [LOS Rev 19.] We'll keep you posted on the games that are going on this afternoon. 161:58:05 CT No problem. The Buckeyes are favored to win and retain their number 1 rating. What essentially we're doing is looking at the effect of primary versus secondary transponder or primary versus secondary electronics and Wide Beam width versus Narrow Beam width.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control at 25 hours, 18 minutes. So this would be the heaters associated with that system. We're standing by for a resumption of conversation...</p>
<p>Carr: I'm going to give you 1-second lead so it will be 10 when it gets there.</p>
<p>Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Carr: Apollo 12, Houston. Question number 3. Roger.?</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, Intrepid.</p>
<p>Carr: Apollo 12, Houston. Thank you.</p>
<p>Carr: 12,Houston. Star number 161 is still good; star number 174 is still good; and 26 is still good for the third sighting. Stand by. We'll give them to you at Carnarvon. He and I have both seen that phenomena on your DEDA during testing of most all the spacecrafts up at Bethpage, and it's probably an EMI.</p>
<p>Carr: Okay, Pete.</p>
<p>Carr: Okay, that takes care of the paper work for this pass.</p>
<p>Carr: That one doesn't compute.</p>
<p>Carr: Ain't that nice! We're consulting our oracle right now.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, Pete. Sure you don't want that geology pop quiz?</p>
<p>Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Okay.</p>
<p>Carr: 12, Houston. Go.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay, Houston. I don't have the complete orange ball in the sextant, but I've got the better half of it.</p>
<p>Gordon: Roger, Omni Bravo.</p>
<p>Bean: Let her go, then.</p>
<p>Gordon: Roger.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, Dick. The computer's yours. Well, that sounds fine, Al.</p>
<p>Carr: Did you get the word that Amy was visited by the tooth fairy?</p>
<p>Carr: Okay, Dick. We saw your manifold pressures change a little bit, so it does look like they fired. Go ahead, Pete.</p>
<p>Gordon: [Garble].</p>
<p>Gordon: I haven't trimmed in roll.</p>
<p>Gordon: Roger. Loud and clear. Houston, 12,</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay, it's all yours.</p>
<p>Gordon: No, sir. Let me know when that thing impacts, so I can shut off this camera, because I can't see it through the telescope?</p>
<p>Gordon: 38:20. I'm reading you.</p>
<p>Conrad: Yes. That makes it pretty nice. None that The water's been chlorinated. The pre-sleep checklist is complete. Go ahead, Houston.</p>
<p>Gordon: Go ahead, Houston.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay. We're ready to copy.</p>
<p>Gordon: Hey, are you doing good? Thank you.</p>
<p>Gordon: Min.</p>
<p>Bean: Yes, Pete.</p>
<p>Bean: Looks like it's right on.</p>
<p>Bean: [Garble] Houston.</p>
<p>Conrad: Mark. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Gordon: Yes. we're all there except for the Servo Electronics to Primary, and I'm in the Secondary Transponder and going to Primary Transponder at this time. Ullage Hello, Houston; Apollo 12.</p>
<p>Gordon: Hey, Ed.</p>
<p>Gordon: These puddings are [garble]  with milk.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger. I don't know that there could be any questions.</p>
<p>Bean: It's almost as high as the rim itself.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control Houston at 170 hours, 4   minutes now into the flight. This is Mission Control, Houston, 5 hours, 1 minute.</p>
<p>Weitz: Hello, 12; Houston. Today's a voting day in Houston as Houston picks a mayor, eight councilmen, four school-board members, and decides upon a number of special issues. Your sextant star is 10, 241.7 A reminder is that the camera settings for your fireball and chutes photos are not in the checklist. The launch is being described with such adjectives as spooky and cliff hanging. Page Delta/Alfa-6, step 1. I can't talk to you any longer, there's another call coming in. The Noun 81 Roger.</p>
<p>Weitz: [Laughter] I'll go on [laughter]. We just want to get a check on the rate.</p>
<p>Weitz: Go ahead, 12. Okay, who won the vote on what you're playing on the tape recorder?</p>
<p>Conrad: Five minutes, 3,403, 156 feet, and out at 47,000.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay. that We'll go get her.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: Roger. And, Al Bean, you give me a Tape Recorder? No, you don't have to do that.</p>
<p>Conrad: Yes, and if you spike both of them, you got the whole shooting match. Would you just give me the Noun 47 again?</p>
<p>Conrad: What happened there?</p>
<p>Conrad: Roll's complete.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay.</p>
<p>Bean: If you can see that.</p>
<p>Conrad: Hey, Dick?</p>
<p>Conrad: That's correct.</p>
<p>Conrad: I'll tell you another thing it is; it's the thrusters
 - 4,500 feet at 30 feet a second. Hell, my window's all foggy.</p>
<p>Weitz: Stand by.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: Apollo 12 now 24,200 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft presently some 5,900 nautical miles from the Moon, traveling at a speed of 4,391 feet per second.</p>
<p>Gordon: Pete, I have you in 60.49 by 9.0.</p>
<p>Carr: Apollo 12, Houston.</p>
<p>Carr: Wilco.</p>
<p>Carr: Thank you. I have a DAP PAD and a TEI-34 PAD for you.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: Well, I don't think we paid that much attention to it, other than when we were aware of it; it was all around us like the Surveyor crater. Hey, Houston, if it's all right with you, we will go ahead and secure the TV.</p>
<p>Conrad: Roger.</p>
<p>Conrad: No, they were that way yesterday. The Service Module thrusters wouldn't show up with water and, even if they did, it would be long gone; and I've still got a big block of ice sitting outside my window here, so I hope they all fire right.</p>
<p>Conrad: It's holding real good, Dick.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 54 minutes Capcom Don Lind is preparing to put in a call to the crew shortly.</p>
<p>Gibson: Well, it looks like we got another page in the malfunction book.</p>
<p>Gibson: Dick, could you give us P00? RTG output is around 73 watts, and as of just a short while ago, they've sent up a total of 382 commands. and the ones coming up. Say again, 12.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, we can go now to the P23 attitude, but we'd like you to roll 180 from that attitude for thermal reasons. We still have a lot of garbling, and broken up.</p>
<p>Gibson: Roger, Dick. [ 00 mins 08 sec]</p>
<p>Gibson: Pete, would you verify that you left the circuit breakers in the LM according to the configuration on activation 3 and 4 except Would you say again?</p>
<p>Gibson: Stand by on that, Pete. Color exterior.</p>
<p>Gibson: Okay, 12. Roger, Al; will do.</p>
<p>Gibson: Hello, 12; Houston. the correct position relative to your mouth.</p>
<p>Gibson: Dick, it sounds good, but you're slightly garbled.</p>
<p>Gibson: Dick, say again. Numbers are good, and that's on page 1-32.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, Houston. Pete, that's affirmative.</p>
<p>Conrad: Say, I guess nobody else has</p>
<p>Conrad: That's it, Al. We just changed out the LiOH canister per Flight Plan, and we're ready for the news.</p>
<p>Bean: Stand by.</p>
<p>Conrad: This kit isn't medication; that's just... You've got a big job now. Dick, you're cleared to go the AGS Cal attitude, and we're standing by.</p>
<p>Conrad: Thank you.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control Houston at 170 hours, 4   minutes now into the flight.</p>
<p>Gibson: Clipper, you have A-C rolls selected in the DAP.</p>
<p>Gibson: Pete and Al, we're back with you.</p>
<p>Gibson: Apollo 12, Houston. 12, go ahead.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, Houston.</p>
<p>Gibson: Okay. While you're sitting there backed up to the fire, we have some news for you, if you like.</p>
<p>Gibson: 12, Houston. That's F:11 for the Earth, F:8 for the Moon.</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control, Houston at 187 hours, and 48 minutes into the flight. We've had discussions with the crew who asked about the type of film to be used in their window photography. Their rest period is scheduled to start on this revolution around the moon. This is Mission Control, Houston, 5 hours, 1 minute.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay. [Garble].</p>
<p>Gordon: Well, hello there, stranger.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay. Up Telemetry, Block, the Command Module; and Up, Block, the IU.</p>
<p>Gordon: Hello, Houston; Clipper.</p>
<p>Bean: 49...</p>
<p>Bean: Off.</p>
<p>Bean: Got drogues, Houston. Here comes something, just...</p>
<p>Conrad: Okay. Houston, Apollo 12.</p>
<p>Conrad:  ...blood to your head at a Take pictures next Rev.</p>
<p>Conrad: Pyro Arm. Let's say you had a strip that was about a foot wide, that you just bent it and made a little triangular thing out of it. Communications throughout the whole launch were outstanding. Watch those...</p>
<p>Public Affairs Office: This is Apollo Control at 127 hours, 9 minutes.</p>
<p>Carr: Roger, 12.</p>
<p>Carr: Intrepid, Houston. Roger.</p>
<p>Carr: That's affirmative. If you need it, go ahead and use it every 3 hours.</p>
<p>Conrad: Show you Just stowing your hose and thing.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Conrad: That's it, pal.</p>
<p>Gordon: The EMS checked out satisfactorily. What goodies?</p>
<p>Gordon: If not, we'll look at the Earth for a while.</p>
<p>Gordon: Houston, this is 12.</p>
<p>Conrad: Any objections to us starting P57 now?</p>
<p>Gordon: I knew you had to have something somewhere. I have 18 millimeter.</p>
<p>Bean: It's coming right out in all directions [garble] slow
 I was thinking they're dropping from my water boiler, but it looks like some of those things are escaping the Moon. Clean up those What we do is, Pete gets over on his side, which is the left side of the spacecraft, this side over here. All that stuff [garble] transfer over.</p>
<p>Bean: Okay, I am going to start doing that right now.</p>
<p>Bean: Okay, do Comm [garble]. Hey, Pete, if you point the camera up there toward the north, you can show them a couple of long rilles.</p>
<p>Conrad: Houston, I can step ahead here and do RCS checkout if you want, right now. That's about all I can say for them. [Singing].</p>
<p>Conrad:  Boy, that would just put the frost on the cake, you know that? Otherwise, it's been steady as a rock.</p>
<p>Conrad: 38 feet per second. This yours, Al?</p>
<p>Conrad: All right.</p>
<p>Conrad: ...your heart's pumping ... You and Joe and all the guys put together a great lunar surface LM; that thing went without a hitch.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay, Houston, the cryos have been stirred for 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Gordon: What's the matter, Al?</p>
<p>Carr: Roger. We're getting a good view of the right-hand compartment now, and we can see your helmet stowage bag down there in the corner, that spherical white bag.</p>
<p>Gordon: Okay.</p>
<p>Gordon: Say again.</p>
<p>Conrad: Don't worry about it; you're in good shape. Okay.</p>
<p>Carr: Okay. We're 1 minute from LOS. 12, Houston. The Saints are looking pretty good. Roger.</p>
<p>Carr: Yankee Clipper, Houston with a P22 tracking PAD. Let us get the state vector in first.</p>
<p>Bean: Yes, I guess.</p>
<p>Weitz: Okay. It's midcourse 7 RCS/G&N; Roger.</p>
<p>Weitz: Got it.</p>
<p>Weitz: You have everybody up and about there? Czechoslovak television carried live coverage of the lift-off, complete with explanation of technical details. We can see it very good. [ 00 mins 31 sec]</p>
<p>Weitz: Roger.</p>
<p>Weitz: Okay. We tried to get an Omni Alfa call to you, but didn't get it in in time, I guess.</p>
<p>Weitz: And, 12; Houston. Give us Omni Bravo, please.</p>
<p>Weitz: Roger. A minimum housing code and a freedom-of-choice integration plan won strong support. We've got it, 12. Roger, Pete.</p></div>
