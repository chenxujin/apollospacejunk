  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: - then we'll get to the waste-water dump [garble]. Sometimes it tells us things and sometimes we tell it things and mostly it talks to us. Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay, Mike, our CDH time is 126:17:45.58.</p>
<p>Collins: Columbia.</p>
<p>Collins: Rotational Hand Controller, number 2, is Armed. I got a horrible squeal.</p>
<p>Aldrin: It's filthy. ]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay. No medication. Over. (Long Pause) Look at that.</p>
<p>Armstrong: In the - I mean, in the reticle. About now, I guess.</p>
<p>Collins: Houston, Columbia.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by? We'd like you to confirm your Up-telemtry switch in the Normal position. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, yes, yes. Go.</p>
<p>McCandless: That's affirmative. They'll hang in there for about another 47 hours or so. AOS at Carnarvon 02:25:30. It may be - are you operating on VOX?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Or could you tell? [Long pause.] Now it's taking it out.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Well, we didn't have any plans to, no. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw.</p>
<p>Collins: ECS Radiator Flow Control, Primary. But that might make it better and maybe a little bit worse.</p>
<p>Duke: Copy. You're a lot better now. Certainly appreciate that.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger. Going to Delta. Have you about maneuvered there, yet? It's just a blow-up of the second one. Sextant star between 79:30:10 and 79:52:10.</p>
<p>Duke: Rog. We need Auto, please, sir.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, I got to go to horizontal at 35. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity.</p>
<p>PAO: Mark. We should next reacquire Apollo 11 at 135 hours, 34 minutes, 5 seconds. Present velocity, 25,560 feet per second. And its maiden checkout in communications, the Lunar Module Eagle looked good. The crew should be burning at this time.</p>
<p>PAO: Mission Director George Hage has just thanked the flight controllers assembled here in the Control Center on behalf of himself and General Phillips for the way in which they conducted this mission.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. And the next question from our panel is to Buzz. We did a minor reconfiguration down here. This is Houston. All systems Go. Over. AOS Tananarive is 2 hours, 9 minutes and 18 seconds. For your information, your heads will be pointed roughly towards the Earth on this burn. Over. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moon-struck by the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Oh, is that right? [Garble] looks okay, Mike.</p>
<p>Collins: Thank you. Is that alright?</p>
<p>Collins: Eagle, Columbia.</p>
<p>Collins: ...so you can - enter on this one. We do likewise.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, we're - we're in DAP control.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger. You suppose you could turn the Earth a little bit so we could get a little bit more than just water? Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Well, Mike probably let him out. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the Command Module.</p>
<p>Duke: Rog, Tranquility. Say again your roll angle, Buzz. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: No.</p>
<p>Duke: Apollo 11, Houston. We... Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Not where the waste management's concerned.</p>
<p>Collins: In the rain.</p>
<p>Aldrin: While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Ouch!</p>
<p>Aldrin: Oh... stop there? Okay?</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, and my optics eyepieces are stowed.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter? I agree with that. Don't you like this one?</p>
<p>Collins: No matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces in their box, it doesn't seem right. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 31365.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Yes.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. Go. Okay, we're there.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay. Here's the pitch. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Evans: Eagle, Houston. Command Module RCS looks fine to us.</p>
<p>PAO: Drogue chute deployment time is 195 hours, 12 minutes, 8 seconds.</p>
<p>Air Boss: This is Air Boss 1.</p>
<p>PAO: Downrange 530 miles, altitude 95 miles, velocity 17,358 feet per second.</p>
<p>Duke: Eagle, this is Houston. Houston. We're ready to spin it up.</p>
<p>Collins: That's affirmative. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: Rog. Houston. And break.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, that's just an old vectors, because I never did Verb 66, I don't think, after [garble].</p>
<p>Armstrong: Shutdown!</p>
<p>Collins: Stand by one. I have conflicting information between my cue card and my Flight Plan.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>Duke: Eagle, this is Houston. We've got a preliminary TEI-30 PAD, if you're ready to copy. Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: You guys agree with my mark; we'll be 5 minutes? It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width as the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Armstrong: The EVA light still does work.</p>
<p>Collins: Do you have any idea whether they landed left or right of center line? Do you have us on high bit rate here now?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston... Copy.</p>
<p>Collins: It's a pleasure to be able to waste gas. I hope they've  got a nice, big, strong [garble] for you.</p>
<p>Armstrong: ...and you could be busy getting up supplies if you... [Long pause.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Yes indeed, Buzz. They're on about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay. Ready to copy. Over. Over. We have just entered Verb 77 on page Surface-52 and are ready to proceed with the hot fire.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Well, I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Roger. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Collins: Plaster of paris gray to me. [Garble.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble.] Suit power is Off.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay. How about the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Did you get that, Mike? I have in F/2-22, column Lima, item 6, 00001; item 7, 02134. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain, but we can clearly see the western coast of North America, the United States, the San Joaquin Valley, the High Sierras, Baja California, and Mexico down as far as Acapulco, and the Yucatan Peninsula; and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezuela, and Colombia.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Yaw 270, pitch minus 50. (Long Pause)</p>
<p>Aldrin: Can you think of any use for a slide rule in the LM, Neil?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Copy.</p>
<p>Armstrong: 11.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Evans: Hey, that's affirmative, by gosh. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. PGNS, AGS, and MSFN all agree.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Roger.</p>
<p>Collins: Columbia. Stand by for ullage.</p>
<p>Collins: Yes, we want color. I still question that seven-tenths rate with two-tenths loaded into the DAP, though. 135 hours, 23 minutes; something like that?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Tape Recorder is going to Command Reset on the High Bit Rate.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. There's no problem fuel-wise.</p>
<p>McCandless: Okay.</p>
<p>Collins: Okay, good. I [garble].</p>
<p>Armstrong: I'll do that, Buzz.</p>
<p>Armstrong: That's more than we've ever had in the simulator, isn't it?</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger, Mike. That sounds fine to us.</p>
<p>McCandless: Okay. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. [Long pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: What time you got?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Right.</p>
<p>Collins: Here's about where we are, [garble]. Is that right?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay. Houston, Eagle.</p>
<p>onboard): Master Arm is On.</p>
<p>onboard): I didn't hear that (garbled)</p>
<p>onboard): Master Arm is On.</p>
<p>onboard): Okay (Long Pause)</p>
<p>onboard): Oh yeah, now I just see the edge of it.</p>
<p>Aldrin: We're burning, Mike. 1344 4793, minus 165 04923. I think that it's about as level as any other areas that we chose.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. They're on about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: (You) got it!</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, 11. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the Flight Plan, and the High Gain angles are good as shown in the Flight Plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131:05 down to 10 percent.</p>
<p>Collins: Columbia's locked up on the high gain, Houston. [Long pause.] [Pause.]</p>
<p>Duke: Apollo 11, Houston. [Pause.]</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Garble] just before that last call.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Can I hold something for you?</p>
<p>Collins: That's all right.</p>
<p>Aldrin: See how am I doing.</p>
<p>Collins: You'll have - You'll have fun at the press conference after this shift then, won't you?</p>
<p>Armstrong: Shades of Gemini. You're right at the edge of the porch.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Alright.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Roll; 000, 007, 000. Over. Over.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Houston, Eagle.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Very good. There are a couple more off to the left, but this one looks [a] fairly good size. I don't think it's because of the waste-water particles that it would lack its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Collins: Thank you.</p>
<p>Aldrin: You can go to your... I got it now.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Still got some here?</p>
<p>Collins: [Garble.]</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. TEI-1, SPS/G&N; 38658, minus 0.54, plus 0.65, T<sub>IG</sub>, 078:02:03.45; plus 2918.0, plus 0377.9, minus 0132.5; roll NA, pitch 041. Is it useful now? [Pause.]</p>
<p>Aldrin: Okay.</p>
<p>McCandless: Mode IV capability. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O<sub>2</sub> flow on your onboard gauge? [Pause.] [No answer.]</p>
<p>McCandless: 11, this is Houston. I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack.</p>
<p>Armstrong: We'll stand by for your call.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going? Okay, through with that? The islands in the Caribbean there, beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. Ron's getting to be known as the silent CapCom. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA one-five (15) minutes from nominal.</p>
<p>Armstrong: ... 190, 110 degrees.</p>
<p>Collins: You ready to do it?</p>
<p>Aldrin: Can't get too much further away. Check my diverter valve's vertical.</p>
<p>Evans: 11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, I see you don't have any landing gear.</p>
<p>Duke: Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell. Stand by. Over.</p>
<p>Collins: 1 or 2 degrees, Neil? Those are Buzz's two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the right-hand window, window Number 5.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Well, I've got one here.</p>
<p>Armstrong: [Simulated crying]</p>
<p>Collins: I'm doing it, Charlie. Sure can.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Well, its a bit like zodiacal light.</p>
<p>Collins: Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation burn attitude.</p>
<p>Duke: And we've got almost 3 minutes to go, Neil. Go ahead, Mike. [Long pause.] Over.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yeah. [Garble].</p>
<p>Duke: Roger, 11. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the Command Module the following items. In the remarks: T-2 occurs at PDI plus 21:26.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Yes, they're not - [garble].</p>
<p>Collins: Circuit breakers - SPS Pitch 1, Pitch 2, Yaw 1, Yaw 2, Open? Buzz is usually looking... just watch window 5 for a second.</p>
<p>Collins: Well, where's the freaking Earth going to be now? It looks like an awful big one.</p>
<p>Collins: Houston, Apollo 11.</p>
<p>McCandless: Roger. We're on low bit rate at the present time so it's going to take us a little bit longer than normal to get this stuff up to you. The High Gain antenna track in Manual.</p>
<p>Aldrin: Sure is squiggly, isn't it?</p>
<p>Collins: Ullage is going to be 16 seconds at 2 jets.</p>
<p>Collins: It's sort of messy. I got my gouge...</p>
<p>Aldrin: Hey, Charlie, I can see the snow on the - on the mountains out in California, and it looks like LA doesn't have much of a smog problem today.</p>
<p>Armstrong: Okay. We appreciate all that fine work done by the - by the Green Team, and we'll be thanking you in person when we get back.</p></div>
